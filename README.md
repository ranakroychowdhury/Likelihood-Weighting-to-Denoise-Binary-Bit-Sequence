# Likelihood_Weighting_to_Denoise_Binary_Bit_Sequence
 
It's easy to compute the decimal equivalent of a binary bit string and vice-versa. However, when the binary bit string pattern is noisy, the detemination of the decimal number is a probabilistic process, not a deterministic one. In this project, I show how we can recover the original binary bit string pattern from its noisy version by using the method Likelihood Weighting. Please refer to Problem 3.6 of the pdf to understand the problem and the solution approach.
